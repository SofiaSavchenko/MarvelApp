# Lab Project Effective Android

## About project

This repository contains laboratory work of the "Mobile Device Programming" course.

This project is designed to run on Android devices.

The application is a list of heroes from the Marvel universe.

## How to use this sample
This sample includes some basic cases that are needed almost for any android app.

So, if you need to setup a new project, it can help you as an example how everything should work overall.

**It's not a bootstrap project, don't use it as a template to start from.**
